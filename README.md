### âœ… **Core Expertise**

* **Backend Development:**

  * **Python** â€“ FastAPI, Django, Flask
  * **GoLang** â€“ GIN for ultra-fast, clean REST APIs
  * **Rust** â€“ Actix Web for secure, memory-safe web services

* **LLM & AI Integration:**

  * Integrated **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **LLaMA**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, and **LangChain** into real-world applications
  * Built **chatbots**, **custom embeddings pipelines**, **semantic search systems**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** backends
  * Deployed LLM-based features with **FastAPI**, **vector databases (pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant)**, and **prompt engineering best practices**

* **Asynchronous Systems:**
  `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, `run_in_executor`, custom message queues, Celery, and task orchestration

* **Database Management:**
  PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLAlchemy (async) â€“ optimized for speed and scalability

* **Web Scraping & Automation:**
  Playwright, Selenium, Scrapy â€“ high-throughput, stealth data pipelines

* **Cloud & DevOps:**
  AWS, GCP, Terraform â€“ serverless, autoscaling, and infrastructure-as-code

* **Containers & Orchestration:**
  Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes â€“ production-ready, modular deployments

* **CI/CD & Testing:**
  GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins â€“ pipelines with Pytest, Cypress, and Selenium

* **Real-time Systems:**
  FastAPI WebSockets, Socket.IO â€“ live notifications, collaborative tools, chat systems

* **GraphQL & Web3:**
  GraphQL APIs, Web3.js, smart contract interaction, blockchain data indexing
